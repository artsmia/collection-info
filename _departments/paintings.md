Mia's internationally acclaimed collection of paintings contains nearly 900 European and American works from the fourteenth century to the present. It offers a comprehensive survey of both celebrated schools and individual artists and is notable for its concentration of masterworks.

One of the museum’s earliest acquisitions was [Gustave Courbet’s Deer in a Forest](http://collections.artsmia.org/art/53/deer-in-the-forest-gustave-courbet), which St. Paul railroad magnate James J. Hill donated in 1914. Hill’s collection of nineteenth-century French Romantic and Realist art was exceptional. Many of his most important pictures, including [Eugène Delacroix’s The Fanatics of Tangier](http://collections.artsmia.org/art/1978/convulsionists-of-tangier-eugene-delacroix), were given or bequeathed to Mia by his descendants.

The present paintings collection has been expanded in varied and often delightfully unpredictable ways by a succession of astute trustees, donors, directors, and curators. It includes [Claude Lorrain’s Pastoral Landscape of 1638](http://collections.artsmia.org/art/5747/pastoral-landscape-claude-gellee), [Nicolas Poussin’s Death of Germanicus of 1627](http://collections.artsmia.org/art/1348/the-death-of-germanicus-nicolas-poussin), and [Rembrandt van Rijn’s Lucretia of 1666](http://collections.artsmia.org/art/529). In addition to many wonderful French nineteenth-century pictures, the museum has rich holdings of Italian Baroque, seventeenth-century Dutch, and Fauve, Cubist, and German Expressionist works. The American collection showcases a range of artistic accomplishments from [Gilbert Stuart](http://collections.artsmia.org/search/artist:%22Gilbert%20Stuart%22) to [Larry Rivers](http://collections.artsmia.org/search/artist:%22Larry%20Rivers%22) and contains exceptional paintings by [John Singer Sargent](http://collections.artsmia.org/search/artist:%22John%20Singer%20Sargent%22/filters/department:%22Paintings%22) and [Georgia O’Keeffe](http://collections.artsmia.org/search/artist:%22Georgia%20O'Keeffe%22).
