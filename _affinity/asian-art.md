Mia’s renowned collection of Asian art represents 17 cultures spanning
nearly 5,000 years. Best known for the size and quality of its Chinese
and Japanese collections, it also has important examples of Indian,
Southeast Asian, Korean, Himalayan, and Islamic art.

The museum acquired its first Asian objects several years before it
formally opened in 1915, and it has continued to build its diverse Asian
collections—through acquisitions and gifts—ever since. Founded in 1977,
the Department of Asian Art now oversees over 12,000 objects, including
sculptures, paintings, ceramics, furniture, lacquers, jades, and
woodblock prints. Its recent acquisition of a [17th century suit of
armor](https://collections.artsmia.org/index.php?page=detail&id=108860) (left)
owned by a Japanese warlord made worldwide news.
