Established with the museum’s opening in 1915, [Mia’s Art Research &
Reference
Library](http://new.artsmia.org/visit/museum-facilities/museum-library/ "Museum Library") is
one of the Midwest’s premiere research centers dedicated to the study of
art. The library’s holdings provide special collection and rare printed
materials as well as digitized texts/images and cutting-edge online
research tools. Spanning the world’s history of art, the library’s
remarkable collection of more than 60,000 volumes continues to grow.

Two notable recent acquisitions include *Edvard Munch: Complete
Paintings—Catalogue Raisonné* and *Vincent van Gogh: The Letters—The
