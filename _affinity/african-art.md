The vast continent of Africa is home to many peoples, societies, and
civilizations, each with unique forms of aesthetic expression. Dramatic
abstraction—particularly of the human figure—is often associated with
African art, whose radical aesthetic exerted enormous influence on
European artists in the first half of the 20th century.

Mia’s collection of sub-Saharan art began in the 1950s with a
magnificent Luba mask and two ancient Benin sculptures. It has grown
steadily ever since and now includes Ethiopian paintings, Moroccan
silver jewelry, central African textiles, a 600-year-old [Djenne
horse-and-rider](https://collections.artsmia.org/index.php?page=detail&id=3183) (left),
and many other outstanding artworks.
