The Department of Prints and Drawings cares for a growing collection of
some 35,000 works of art ranging from the Middle Ages to the present.
Hundreds of artists are represented in this encyclopedic collection,
many in considerable depth. Well-known figures include
Dürer, [Rembrandt](https://collections.artsmia.org/index.php?page=detail&id=8231) (left),
Piranesi, Tiepolo, Goya, Daumier, Whistler, Cassatt, Toulouse-Lautrec,
Picasso, Kirchner, Rauschenberg, and Ruscha.

The hugely varied collection encompasses prints, drawings, watercolors,
pastels, illuminated manuscripts, and printed books. The department
organizes about ten exhibitions each year and welcomes hundreds of
visitors to the Herschel V. Jones [Print Study
Room](http://new.artsmia.org/visit/museum-facilities/study-rooms/ "Print & Photographs Study Rooms").
