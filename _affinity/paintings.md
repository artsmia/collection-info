Mia’s internationally acclaimed collection of paintings contains nearly
900 European and American works from the 14th century to 1960. It offers
a comprehensive survey of both celebrated schools and individual artists
and is notable for its concentration of masterworks by such artists as
Rembrandt, Courbet, Delacroix, Poussin, van Gogh, Sargent, and O’Keeffe.

Recent additions include Arthur Wesley Dow’s [*The
Destroyer*](https://collections.artsmia.org/index.php?page=detail&id=108705) (left),
a luminous depiction of the Colorado River cutting through the Grand
Canyon, and a small but radiant*Seashore* by James Abbott McNeill
Whistler, the collection’s first painting by this celebrated artist.
