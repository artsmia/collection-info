Mia houses one of the nation’s finest collections of European and
American decorative arts, including furniture, design, silver, ceramics,
and glass. In addition to 12 period rooms housed within the museum, the
museum also owns the 1913 Purcell-Cutts House, a Prairie School-style
architect’s home in the historic Kenwood neighborhood of Minneapolis.

The sculpture collection encompasses Mediterranean, European, and
post-colonial American works from ancient times until 1960. Recent
acquisitions include a superb [18th century silver cup with

by the Strasbourg silversmith Johann Friedrich Baer.
