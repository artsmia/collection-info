The museum’s Native American art collection celebrates the artistic
achievements of America’s first peoples. The collection began with a
gift of 25 objects from the Northwest Coast in 1928. The collection now
encompasses nearly 1,500 objects from the major cultural regions across
the continent, from ancient to contemporary times.

Noted pieces include a Bella Coola frontlet from the Northwest Coast, an
Anishinabe beaded blanket from Minnesota, a painted tipi cover from the
Plains, and a ceramic and silver collection from the Southwest region.
Recent acquisitions include a large, vibrantly painted kachina figure
representing the [Butterfly
Maiden](https://collections.artsmia.org/index.php?page=detail&id=108692) (left),
a Hopi symbol of regeneration and renewal.
