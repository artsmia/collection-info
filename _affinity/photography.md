Begun in 1973, Mia’s collection spans the history of photography from
the 1840s to the present. Representing more than 800 photographers and
11,500 works of art, the collection consists primarily of 20th-century
American work, with particular depth in documentary, photojournalism,
and pictorialism.

Mia is now expanding its holdings of historic avant-garde experiments as
well as contemporary photography and new media from all countries.
Notable additions include photographs by the Ukrainian artist [Boris
Mikhailov](https://collections.artsmia.org/index.php?page=detail&id=109032) (left)
and a video by American Doug Aitken that poignantly comments on
mankind’s encroachment on natural habitats.
