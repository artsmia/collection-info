In 2008, the museum founded its first department dedicated to the art of
our times. The Department of Contemporary Art brings a fresh dynamism to
its galleries by collecting and exhibiting works by living artists of
national and international renown. This initiative emphasizes the
relationships among historical art, diverse cultures, and contemporary
art-making.

Activities include expanding the collection, organizing exhibitions, and
working with artists-in-residence to create public and site-specific
work at Mia. Recent acquisitions include Mona Hatoum’s 2008 barbed
wire [*Cube* (9x9x9)](https://collections.artsmia.org/index.php?page=detail&id=109122) (left),
which conjures feelings of danger and discomfort in an uncertain world,
and Yayoi Kusama’s 1967 exuberant painting of dots and interlocking
shapes.
