Patrick has been the senior curator of paintings at Mia since moving to Minneapolis in 1997. He was previously the founding curator of Prints, Drawings, and Rare Books at the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, Connecticut, where he organized 80 exhibitions in 20 years, including “The English Miniature” (1981) in collaboration with the Victoria and Albert Museum and “The Human Form Divine, William Blake from the Paul Mellon Collection” (1997). He has published and lectured extensively on French and British art from the 1700s and 1800s, focusing on the relationships between artists working in different countries, particularly during the Romantic era. This expertise has informed many exhibitions, including “Crossing the Channel: British and French Painting in the Age of Romanticism,” organized with the Tate Britain and the Metropolitan Museum of Art and shown at Mia in 2003, as well as the catalogues raisonnés he published in 2008/10 of the paintings and drawings of British Romantic artist Richard Parkes Bonington, who mediated the British and French schools in the 1820s. His exploration of French Romantic painter Eugène Delacroix’s influence—“Delacroix and the Rise of Modern Art”— was organized with the National Gallery in London and debuted at Mia in 2015.
