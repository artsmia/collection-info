“Jackson Pollock’s paintings and working with Kiki Smith on her first one-person museum show inspired me to pursue a career in the arts, that is, after I realized that I was several steps slow and many vertical inches short of a career as a pro basketball player. Roland Barthes’ <em>Camera Lucida</em> remains one of my favorite books on photography and on the art of writing. While researching my dissertation on a New York artists' group, I once turned down an invitation to an opening from a well known contemporary artist and writer. I wanted to research at home instead. He responded by challenging my decision, stating, ‘You read books and I read lips!’ Since that moment, reading lips and spending time looking at art with artists has been a major part of my work as a curator and historian.”
