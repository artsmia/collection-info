Andreas oversees Mia’s renowned collection of Japanese and Korean art. He came to Mia from the Clark Center for Japanese Art and Culture, in California, where he was the director and chief curator for five years starting in 2008. The collection doubled during his tenure and garnered a global reputation for its singular connoisseurship before coming to Mia, along with Andreas, in 2013. He has written extensively about Japanese art, including <i>Japanese Woodblock Prints: Artists, Publishers, and Masterworks 1680–1900</i>, the first compendium of woodblock publishers, named an Outstanding Title by <i>CHOICE Reviews</i> in 2010. He studied for his MA (2004) in East Asian Art History, Chinese Studies, and Psychology at the University of Bonn, in Germany, while managing international student recruitment fairs starting in 1993. He received his PhD in Japanese Studies (2010) from Leiden University, in the Netherlands, and spent two years in Tokyo on research fellowships. He speaks German, is proficient in Japanese, and is a devoted collector with over 300 woodblock prints, hanging scrolls, and ceramics.
