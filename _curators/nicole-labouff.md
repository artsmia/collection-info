Nicole works with Mia’s remarkable collection of textiles, particularly those from Europe and America. A Los Angeles native, she came to Mia in 2013 after working for six years in the Department of Costume and Textiles at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. There, she developed an exhibition on Elza Sunderland’s iconic mid-20th century textile designs and helped showcase the museum’s recent acquisition of 18th- and 19th-century European garments. She has a background in anthropology, studied for her MPhil (1997) in archaeology at the University of Cambridge, and for her MA (2001) in art history and the history of dress at the Courtauld Institute of Art. For her PhD from the University of California, Irvine (2013), she countered notions that women’s domestic needlework—ubiquitous throughout Renaissance Europe—distanced women from learning, showing that the surviving embroideries of Mary, Queen of Scots and Bess of Hardwick were influenced by the books they read.
