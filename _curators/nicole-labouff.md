Nicole works with Miaâ€™s remarkable collection of textiles, particularly those from Europe and America. A Los Angeles native, she came to Mia in 2013 after working for six years in the Department of Costume and Textiles at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. She has a background in anthropology, studied for her MPhil (1997) in archaeology at the University of Cambridge, and for her MA (2001) in art history and the history of dress at the Courtauld Institute of Art. For her PhD in history from the University of California, Irvine (2013), she studied the surviving 16th century embroideries of Mary, Queen of Scots and Bess of Hardwick. At Mia, Nicole has overseen a number of exhibitions, including Italian Style (2012), Cut from the Same Cloth: American Quilts at Mia (2016), and several period room reinstallations as part of the Living Rooms project.
