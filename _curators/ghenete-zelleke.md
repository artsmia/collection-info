Ghenete oversees Mia’s wide-ranging collection of more than 18,000 works of silver, porcelain, glassware, textiles, furniture, sculpture, and other decorative arts, as well as the museum’s period rooms and the Purcell-Cutts House. She came to Mia in 2016, after 25 years at the Art Institute of Chicago. Among the exhibitions she curated at the AIC were shows on the designs of Scottish architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh, the furniture of Austrian designer Josef Hoffmann, and 18th-century French porcelain from Vincennes and Sevres. In 2012, she helped lead the development of LaunchPad, an interactive iPad exploration of 50 artworks in the AIC’s decorative arts galleries—a model for Mia’s own ArtStories application. She also oversaw the three-year design and reinstallation of the AIC’s acclaimed European Decorative Arts galleries and led the integration of decorative objects into displays of European paintings and sculpture. Ghenete received her MA in the History of European Decorative Arts from the Cooper-Hewitt Museum/Parsons School of Design and her BA in the History of Art from the University of Cambridge.
