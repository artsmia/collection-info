Aaron came to Mia in 2015 to work with the museum’s world-class collection of Japanese and Korean art. He specializes in pre-modern Japanese paintings, which comprise the core of the renowned Burke Collection recently donated to the museum. A native of Indiana, he attended Indiana University where he studied the history of Chinese art and, later, Japanese art. Following undergraduate studies, he spent two years teaching English in Nara, Japan, before pursuing graduate work at Columbia University, where he earned his MA, MPhil, and PhD. His doctoral research focused on the early reception of Chinese ink painting and the forging of a distinctive local painting style by Zen painters active in medieval eastern Japan. He spent four years in Japan as a visiting researcher at the University of Tokyo and Gakushūin University. From 2014–15 he was a Jane and Morgan Whitney Fellow in the Department of Asian Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He speaks fluent Japanese and has written and spoken widely on the influence of China on the arts of Japan.

Q: You went to college thinking you would be a music major—you played the bassoon. When did you fall for Asian art?

AARON RIO: I grew up in southern Indiana without any exposure to Asia or Asian art. But in my very first semester at Indiana University I decided, quite arbitrarily, to take a course on Chinese landscape painting and was immediately hooked. I originally tried to straddle the fields of Chinese and Japanese art before turning more fully to Japan. China’s artistic influence is ubiquitous in the arts of Japan—even when you think it isn’t there, it’s there.

Q: A single painting spurred you to turn to Japanese art, particularly the confluence of Chinese literary culture and Japanese Zen painting. What’s the story?

AR: I saw it at an exhibition in New York in 2007: a large triptych of ink paintings painted by a Japanese artist in the 15th century. It is centered on Kannon, a bodhisattva [a being that, according to Buddhist tradition, postpones its own buddhahood in order to help others attain enlightenment], flanked by two ancient Chinese poets, Tao Qian and Li Bai. I was fascinated by the process by which two literary heroes from Chinese antiquity came to be paired with Kannon in a medieval Japanese Buddhist painting. I still haven’t fully addressed the problem, because I got sidetracked investigating the artist to whom the triptych was then attributed, a painter called Chūan Kinkō (also known as Chūan Shinkō), who became the focus of my PhD thesis.

Q: The story of the early development of ink painting in Japan is only partially told. You try to retell the story from the beginning, tracing it back to Zen temples in eastern Japan, where monks had assembled great caches of Chinese paintings and other works of art.

AR: The story of Japanese ink painting is usually told a certain way, from the perspective of Kyoto, the political and cultural center for most of Japan’s history. I had to ignore Kyoto in a way in order to tell the story of the emergence of ink painting in medieval Kamakura, then the administrative capital and the early center of Zen Buddhism in Japan. Generations of Zen painter-priests used these local temple collections of Chinese paintings to create their own works, eventually developing a distinctive style unique to Kamakura and the region. I spent a year working on a single inventory of the collection of one of these temples consisting of thousands of Chinese paintings, calligraphy, ceramics, lacquer—a wellspring for local painters.

Q: How do you engage museum visitors in Japanese ink paintings, which can seem rather esoteric in the West?

AR: It’s a challenge. You have to take your time with ink paintings. Maybe they’re 500, 600 years old, the silk has darkened, the ink may have faded, the image may be difficult to make out. A monochrome image of a bodhisattva on darkened silk will fade into the background next to, say, a gilded folding screen with red and white hollyhocks, the kind of dynamic, colorful picture that many people associate with Japanese painting. I remember the first time I saw a monochrome Chinese landscape painting, I didn’t know quite what I was looking at: what first looked only like a swirl of ink turned out to be a monumental mountain. But one of the things I love about ink painting is seeing the traces of the act of painting, seeing how the artist’s hand moved, where he put the brush down and picked it up, where he applied pressure. There’s a wonderful pair of ink paintings from the Burke Collection, now here at Mia, by a 14th-century Zen priest who paints these fabulously long, slender orchid leaves, extending across the surface of the painting like ribbons. You can see his brush moving more than half a millennium later. I can’t wait to show it in the galleries.
