Yasufumi came to Mia in 2016 and oversees the museum’s collections of photography, video, and other time-based media. A native of Osaka, Japan, he earned a JD from the University of Wisconsin Law School and practiced law in New York City and Tokyo for seven years. After the galvanizing shock of 9/11, he embarked on a study of modern and contemporary art, earning his MA from Hunter College of the City University of New York and his PhD from Cornell University. Prior to joining Mia, he was the associate curator of photography at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, where in eight years he organized a dozen exhibitions and brought approximately 700 photographs into the collection. His exhibitions and books include Katsura: Picturing Modernism in Japanese Architecture, Photographs by Ishimoto Yasuhiro (2010), which received the 2011 Alfred H. Barr Jr. Award for Smaller Museums, Collections, Libraries and Exhibitions from the College Art Association, and For a New World to Come: Experiments in Japanese Art and Photography, 1968–1979 (2015). An expert in post-1945 global art and photography, he has taught East Asian modern and contemporary art and architecture at Rice University and Hunter College and spoken on the subject at universities and symposia in Asia, Europe, and the United States.
