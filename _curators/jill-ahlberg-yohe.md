  Assistant Curator of Native American Art
---

Jill oversees the museum’s collection of Native American art. She arrived at Mia in 2014, having previously served as assistant curator and Mellon Fellow of Native American Art at the St. Louis Art Museum. There, she installed the museum’s first three permanent galleries of Native American art and collaborated with Lakota artist Arthur Amiotte and Crow artist Wendy Red Star to bring a native understanding to works from their respective communities. She grew up in rural Pennsylvania, received her BA from the University of Maryland, and studied anthropology for her MA at the University of New Mexico. For her PhD (2008), also from the University of New Mexico, she focused on Navajo textiles, learning the Navajo language and living on the vast Navajo reservation for 4.5 years. Among her initiatives at Mia is showcasing native Minnesota artists, highlighting the art of native women, and bringing native perspectives to bear on the museum’s collection.

Q: You’re a farm girl from the Pennsylvania countryside. How did you become interested in Navajo weaving?

JILL AHLBERG YOHE: I’ll never forget the director of the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology, at the University of New Mexico, taking me into the basement storage and cranking open the vault of Navajo textiles. There were hundreds of wrapped Navajo textiles, just incredible. And I realized that in order to know that art, I needed to know the people. There’s just no way to understand the mastery and brilliance without understanding the culture.

Q: You spent years on the Navajo reservation, researching weaving. What was that like?

Jill: I always joke that it took about six months for anyone to talk to me, but it’s true. I took classes in the Navajo language and I worked at a senior center delivering food to elders. But I had to present the goal of my fieldwork—in Navajo—at a Chapter House meeting in front of about 150 Navajo people, and then I could go forth. It was the scariest thing I’ve ever done in my life. I eventually became great friends with people who knew other people and we’d go into the hinterlands to visit with weavers and understand how weaving is used in a variety of ways in Navajo life.

Q: How do you think about the dichotomy often made with Native American objects between culture and art, aesthetics and use?

Jill: One of the ways I avoid that pitfall is to understand the work from the viewpoint of the culture from which it’s made. What distinctions do Lakota people make regarding design, technique, and artistry—what criteria does the community itself use to distinguish the best pieces? It’s the same with Navajo textiles: There’s an implicit understanding among Navajo artists and scholars of what constitutes a masterwork, and they can guide you—this one is better for these reasons.

 Q: What trends are you seeing in contemporary native art?

Jill: I firmly believe that contemporary Native American art is going to go mainstream in the next decade. Some of the most important, innovative contemporary art right now is coming from native artists. There’s more freedom, more attention, and more possibilities for native artists. Right now, the Upper Midwest—and Minnesota in particular—is the most important place for native artists in the country, in terms of the sheer amount of great art being produced. From established artists to the up-and-coming, it’s just extraordinary.
