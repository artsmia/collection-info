Gabriel came to Mia in 2016 to oversee its Department of Contemporary Art. He had been The Nancy and Tim Hanley Assistant Curator of Contemporary Art at the Dallas Museum of Art (DMA) since 2012. There, he organized the DMA’s long-running “Concentrations” series of exhibitions on internationally emerging and underrepresented artists, worked with artists and arts organizations in the Dallas area to strengthen ties with the DMA, and grew the museum’s contemporary art collection through key acquisitions. In 2015, he co-organized “Between Action and the Unknown: The Art of Kazuo Shiraga and Sadamasa Motonaga,” the first major American exhibition of these influential artists. He also served as the DMA curator for the traveling exhibitions “International Pop” (2015) and “Cindy Sherman” (2013). As an independent curator, Gabriel has worked around the world, creating exhibitions of emerging artists from the United States, Europe, and Asia. As a 2011 Japan Foundation Doctoral Fellow at the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, he researched Japanese surrealism of the 1930s and ’40s. His expertise in Japanese modern and contemporary art has informed exhibitions such as Out of the Ordinary: New Video from Japan (2007) at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, where he worked as a curatorial assistant.
