Yang came to Mia in 2011 and oversees one of the finest wide-ranging collections of Chinese art outside China itself. A native of Zhejiang province near Hangzhou, the capital and one of China’s most scenic cities, Yang taught briefly at the International Studies University in Beijing before studying for his PhD in Chinese art history and archaeology at the University of London’s School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS). After receiving his PhD in 1997, he became the senior curator of Chinese art at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, in Sydney, Australia. There, his exhibition of Chinese terracotta warriors set an attendance record, and three books he authored (two exhibition catalogs and a collection study) won awards. Among his first projects at Mia was assembling another terracotta warriors exhibition, which similarly became the most popular show at the museum in 20 years. Yang’s research into the collection has yielded important discoveries, including new insights into the origins of the museum’s prized Chinese bronzes. And his help in facilitating relations with Chinese museums has resulted in an unprecedented exchange of art and personnel.
