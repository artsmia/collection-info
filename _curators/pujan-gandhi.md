Pujan Gandhi came to Mia in the autumn of 2018. He was previously based
in his hometown of Atlanta, where he served as a consulting curator at
the High Museum of Art while working independently on exhibitions in
Midland, Texas, and Mumbai. Pujan completed his BA at Middlebury
College, and his postgraduate diploma and MA in the History of Art and
Archaeology at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS),
University of London. During his studies, he interned at several
international art galleries and cataloged in the Asian Art Department at
the British Museum. After graduate school, he ran his own art advisory
business, focused on Indian miniature painting, classical South Asian
sculpture, and global modern and contemporary art. He also guest
lectured at SOAS. In 2015, he was shortlisted for Spear’s “Young Turk
Art Advisor” of the year award.  While his dissertation focused on early
Jain art (c. 100 BCE to 300 CE) at a site in Mathura, India, Pujan
considers himself an avid generalist.  He looks forward to stewarding
Mia’s South, Southeast Asian, and Islamic collections, while deepening
the community’s engagement with the dynamic arts of these vast regions.
