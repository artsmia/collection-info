<p>Kaywin Feldman, Director and President of the Minneapolis Institute of Art (Mia) since 2008, is a nationally known museum director and curator. At Mia, Feldman manages an 83,000-object, fine-art collection, housed in a 473,000–square-foot facility, with an annual operating budget of $25 million, and a full-time staff of more than 250.</p>

<p>She is a current board member of the <a href="http://www.aam-us.org/">American Association of Museums (AAM)</a>, past president of the <a href="http://www.aamd.org/">Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD)</a>, and board member, past board secretary, and past committee chair of the organization.</p>

<p><img alt="Kaywin Feldman" src="http://www.artsmia.org/UserFiles/Image/about-the-museum/kaywin.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="8" />Before assuming her position at Mia, Feldman was Director of the <a href="http://brooksmuseum.org/">Memphis Brooks Museum of Art</a>, from 1999 to 2007.

<p>Feldman has a reading knowledge of French, Italian, Dutch, German, Spanish, Latin, and Greek, and her specialties are Dutch and Flemish art and Greek and Roman archaeology. She was therefore delighted to be instrumental in acquiring an elegant Dutch master painting by Willem de Poorter for Mia in 2011. In 2009, Feldman brought masterpieces from the Musée du Louvre to Mia.</p>

<p>A member of the Minnesota Women’s Economic Roundtable since 2009, Feldman has also served as a board member of several Tennessee, California, and Minnesota arts and community associations.

<p>Feldman’s education is widespread. She received an Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from the Memphis College of Art in 2008. She worked on PhD thesis research and received a fellowship from the Ministry of the Flemish Community from 1991 through 1993, and was awarded an Overseas Research Studentship by the University of London.</p>

<p>Feldman received her MA in art history at the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London; her MA in museum studies at the Institute of Archaeology, University of London; and BA (summa cum laude) in classical archaeology, University of Michigan, where she was Phi Beta Kappa and an Angell Scholar.</p>

She has lectured and written extensively. She and her husband, Jim Lutz (Lecturer/Co-Director MS Sustainable Design Program at the School of Architecture at the University of Minnesota and architectural historian), live in an original “WeeHouse” designed by Twin Cities architect Geoffrey Warner of Alchemy Architects.</p>

During her tenure, Mia has strengthened its national presence with ambitious special exhibitions, including <em>More Real?: Art in the Age of Truthiness</em> (Mia’s first blockbuster contemporary art exhibition), <em>Rembrandt in America</em>, and <em>China’s Terracotta Warriors</em>.
