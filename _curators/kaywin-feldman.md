<p>She is a current board member of the <a href="http://www.aam-us.org/">American Association of Museums (AAM)</a>, past president of the <a href="http://www.aamd.org/">Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD)</a>, and board member, past board secretary, and past committee chair of the organization.</p>

<p>Feldman has a reading knowledge of French, Italian, Dutch, German, Spanish, Latin, and Greek, and her specialties are Dutch and Flemish art and Greek and Roman archaeology.

She has lectured and written extensively. She and her husband, Jim Lutz (Lecturer/Co-Director MS Sustainable Design Program at the School of Architecture at the University of Minnesota and architectural historian), live in an original “WeeHouse” designed by Twin Cities architect Geoffrey Warner of Alchemy Architects.</p>
