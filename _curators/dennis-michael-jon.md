A specialist in modern, postwar, and contemporary works on paper and artists’ books, he has organized and overseen more than 65 exhibitions, exploring such subjects as labor and industry, war and its consequences, homicide, art and nature, spirituality, the book as art object, and the history of the American Presidency. His exhibit projects have included solo presentations of the work of Robert Rauschenberg, Richard Hamilton, Ed Ruscha, Eduardo Paolozzi, John Cage, May Stevens, Michael Mazur, James Castle, Alexander Calder, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso, Joan Mirό, Anders Zorn, and James McNeil Whistler. He has authored and co-authored more than a dozen books and numerous articles and essays on subjects related to his specialization, including the catalogue raisonné of the published prints and multiples of Vermillion Editions Limited, a Minneapolis-based collaborative print workshop, whose archive is part of Mia’s permanent collection.
