Robert Cozzolino began at Mia on February 29, 2016—a leap day. He has
been called the “curator of the dispossessed” for championing
underrepresented artists and uncommon perspectives on well-known
artists. He has collaborated with many contemporary artists, and in 2014
organized the largest American museum exhibition of David Lynch’s visual
art. A native of Chicago, he studied at the University of Illinois at
Chicago before receiving his MA and PhD (2006) from the University of
Wisconsin–Madison. In his work on American art he has emphasized
regional diversity, integrating artists of Illinois, Wisconsin,
California, and other areas into installations, thematic exhibitions,
and his scholarship. Before joining Mia he was the senior curator and
Evelyn and Will Kaplan Curator of Modern Art at the Pennsylvania Academy
of the Fine Arts (PAFA) in Philadelphia, where he oversaw more than 30
exhibitions, including retrospectives of George Tooker, Peter Blume, and
Elizabeth Osborne. He acquired more than 2,000 objects for PAFA, mostly
gifts, including the Linda Lee Alter Collection of Art by Women and
major collections of work by Sue Coe, Ellen Lanyon, and Miriam Schapiro.
