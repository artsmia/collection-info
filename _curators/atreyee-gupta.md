Atreyee came to Mia in 2016. She is an expert on global modernism, particularly the flow of ideas and aesthetics across Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America beginning in the 20th century. She earned her BA from the Faculty of Fine Arts, Baroda, in India, and her PhD from the University of Minnesota–Twin Cities. She began her career at the Hong Kong–based Asia Art Archive, and subsequently taught at the University of Minnesota–Duluth and the University of California–Berkeley. From 2013 to 2016, she was based in Germany, including fellowships at the contemporary art museum Haus der Kunst, in Munich, and the Forum Transregionale Studien, a humanities and social-sciences research center in Berlin. She recently co-curated _Converging Cultures_, an exhibition on the impact of the Asian diaspora on Latin American art, for the Art Museum of the Americas in Washington, D.C. Atreyee has spoken on 20th-century South Asian art at museums and universities in Asia, Europe, and the United States, and written extensively on the subject. Her publications include the coedited volumes _Postwar–Art between the Pacific and the Atlantic, 1945–1965,_ and _Global Modernism/s: Infrastructures of Contiguities, ca. 1905–1965_, as well as several essays in exhibition catalogs, books, and peer-reviewed journals.
