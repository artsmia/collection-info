Rachel came to Mia in 2006. A Minnesota native, she grew up in Deephaven, where she lives with her husband and two children. She graduated from Breck School and Colgate University. She earned a MA and PhD from the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, where she wrote her dissertation on The Young Guido Reni: The Artist in Bologna and Rome, 1575–1605 (2007). While her first love is Old Master drawings, Rachel was drawn to the art of engraving when she worked for two years after college in the Silver Department at Christie’s New York. While in graduate school, she worked at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as an exhibition assistant in Drawings and Prints and as a research assistant in European Paintings. She has taught art history at Stony Brook University and the University of Minnesota–Twin Cities. In 2010, she helped Mia acquire Jacopo de’ Barbari’s monumental bird’s-eye View of Venice, a rare Renaissance woodcut from 1500, and is organizing an exhibition around the work and artist (“The Enigmatic World of Jacopo de’ Barbari”). In 2014, she completed a catalogue of Mia’s drawings collection, Master Drawings from the Minneapolis Institute of Art, a companion to a related exhibition that has toured the United States.
