Jan-Lodewijk came to Mia in 2008 as its first curator of African art. He led the innovative reinstallation of Mia’s African galleries in 2013, making artworks more accessible through design and technology. He has broadened the collection through numerous acquisitions, including pieces from Somalia and Ethiopia—the Twin Cities has large immigrant communities from the Horn of Africa—and West African masks and ornaments donated by William Siegmann from Minneapolis. A native of Belgium, Jan-Lodewijk studied cultural anthropology at the University of Chicago for his PhD, specializing in central Africa. His fieldwork on the beliefs of the Zande people in the Central African Republic eventually led to his groundbreaking 2007 exhibition, “Ubangi: Art and Cultures from the African Heartland,” at the Afrika Museum in the Netherlands. At Mia, his “iAfrica” show (2009) experimented with multisensory experiences, while “Visions from the Forests: The Art of Liberia and Sierra Leone” (2014) offered a timely forum on the ravages of Ebola. He has researched the religious art and architecture of Islamic Africa, exploring the diversity and uniqueness of artistic expression in the African practice of Islam.
