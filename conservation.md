* The Minneapolis Institute of Artâ€™s campus houses the [Midwest Art Conservation Center (MACC)](http://www.preserveart.org/), an independent, non-profit regional center for the preservation and conservation of art and artifacts.

* Mia frequently partners with MACC to preserve artworks in the collection for generations to come. Looking closely at an artwork to understand its condition and develop a plan to preserve it provides a wealth of information about the artwork itself, the materials from which it is made, and the techniques of the artist who created it. Mia is committed to making this information accessible to the public and to other researchers. Several projects are presented here.
