The Purcell-Cutts House, designed and built by William Gray Purcell and George Grant Elmslie, is a masterpiece of Prairie School architecture. Located at 2328 Lake Place in Minneapolis, the house has been extensively restored and is now a part of the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Art.

[Unified Vision, an online interactive media program][1], explores the modern concepts of unified design through the exemplary Prairie School collection at the Minneapolis Institute of Art. Featured is an online tour of the Purcell-Cutts house.

## Purcell-Cutts House Window Conservation Project

The art glass windows in the Purcell-Cutts House are a signifcant contribution to its success as an example of the Prairie School style of architecture. The windows have aged well since the house was completed in December 1913, but several are in need of imminent repair. Architect George Grant Elmslie provided the designs for the windows to E. L. Sharretts’s Mosaic Art Shops of Minneapolis. Sharretts fabricated them using zinc came (metal channels that hold together the glass panes) and various types of glass: clear craquelure, colored opalescent, green tint hammered glass, and window glass.

From June through September 2016, six windows and their sashes are being conserved, as well as the sashes of two other windows, all from the second  oor of the house. Several of these windows are from the east (front) façade of the house, where excessive exposure to sunlight and built-up heat between the art glass windows and the interior storm windows have degraded the grout securing the glass in the cames, causing bowing and leaking.

Because the windows are objects in the Minneapolis Institute of Art’s collection (the house is the largest object in the collection), they are being conserved to maintain as many of their original parts as possible. The Midwest Art Conservation Center (MACC) in Minneapolis is conducting the window conservation under the supervision of art glass conservator Drew Anderson of New York City. MACC conservators will stabilize and flatten the zinc came, waterproof the windows, and clean both sides of the art glass. Chiral Arts LLC of St. Paul, Minnesota, will repair the window sashes under the supervision of Stuart MacDonald, AIA, of Minneapolis. After the windows are reinstalled in September 2016, Mia will insert climate monitors near the windows with the goal of better stabilizing their environmental conditions in the future.
